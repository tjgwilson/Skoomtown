            <p>🚀 Greetings cosmic travelers! 🚀</p>

            <p>For those who don’t know me, I am the designated overthinker, and one of many core organisers of Skoomtown. Myself and Martha-jo Dare run a series of games each year which build the weird & wonderful storyline and lore of Skoomtown. As such, I have THREE important announcements to make in preparation;</p>

            <p>🛸👩‍🚀⭐️1) Friday⭐️👩‍🚀🛸</p>

            <p>Firstly, there are some important things happening on Friday, starting with the opening ceremony at 1pm, where the TMSS Skoomy McSkoomFace will be opened by our dutiful King & Queen and their supporting officials. Immediately following the opening ceremony, the storyline will kick off with our first event/game. Later on, the ship will launch at approximately 7:30pm, but we are expecting a few people to catch up with us in ancillary shuttles on Saturday 🚀</p>

            <p>(If you miss any of the story events, no stress, we’re not expecting everyone to get involved in every part – there will be 1 big storyline event each day, as well as other little bits)</p>

            <p>🍹🍺👽2) Drinks Competition 👽🍺🍹</p>

            <p>This leads nicely into the second announcement, the return of our traditional drinks competition. This will be the second big storyline event, starting at 3pm on Saturday afternoon. The theme this year is simply to design and bring the gayest cosmological cocktail, elixir, or tonic – a potion to assist in the mandatory 15% increase in gay vibes for those who might be struggling to meet the quota 🌈 As usual a full ingredients list will be required for the tasters, and presentation of the beverages will be just as important as taste and design!</p>

            <p>🧩🎲👑 3) Story & Games; 👑🎲🧩</p>

            <p>As some of you may know, this year we are diverging from our usual ‘taskmaster-esque’ competitive team games to a more co-operative (but still slightly competitive) story-based structure, for which everyone will get the choice to join one of 4 exciting factions! Over the next 2 weeks, each faction will post on this page, summarising what they’re about and why you should join them.</p>

            <p>If you feel strongly about joining a certain faction, shoot me a message with your 1st and 2nd choices, and I’ll do my best to accommodate everyone’s preferences whilst balancing numbers. You can add me on facebook to message, you can drop a comment below, or you can text/whatsapp me on 07530275810.</p>

            <p>I can’t wait to catch up with returning Skoomers and meet our new recruits! I hope everyone is as excited as we are on the planning team. We’re all absolutely stoked and working hard to make this the best Skoomtown yet! 🌠🔫🤖</p>

        <!-- Second Update -->
        <div class="update-post">

            <img src="images/flightcrew_promo.png" alt="Flight Crew Promo" class="update-image">

            <p>Your Flight Crew Needs You!</p>

            <p>We may not be the most glamorous faction, we cannot offer you the indolent lifestyle of a Royal or the spiritual fulfilment of a cult member, but what we have is our guts, our guile and our glorious ability to drink a whole bottle of whiskey without batting an eye!</p>

            <p>We in the Flight Crew know that, without our scrupulous attention and can-do attitude, this ship will never make it out of Earth's orbit. It is down to us and us alone to make sure this voyage successfully reaches its destination, regardless of the hurdles ahead.</p>

            <p>When all others succumb to panic in the face of an oncoming meteor shower it will be our talented pilots that carry us through the danger. When an infestation of space mosquitos takes up residence in the artificial gravity controls, it will be our fearless officers that strap on their sticky boots and eradicate the swarm with nothing but their wits and a nerf gun. When a drunken Royal spills their cup of Buckfastleigh Tonic Wine on the navigation panel and puts the ship on a collision course for a black hole, who else but our brilliant engineers will be able to strip out the caffeinated residue and return the control panel to perfect operation.</p>

            <p>We are the backbone of this ship, overworked and underappreciated but nevertheless the best of the best! If you feel like someone who's talents would suit the Flight Crew then sign up today!</p>
